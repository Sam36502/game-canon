# Game Canon

I felt like making some basic games and relatively simple projects in order to just hone my programming skills further and because it sounds fun.

The code included here is mostly just to throw something together and make something roughly functional; It is not pretty and the architecture could be
improved in several way, but that's really the whole point of the project anyway. I wanted a way to just try things out and see what kinds of problems
you have to solve in order to implement various game features.
